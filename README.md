Firmware for a DYI evaporative humidifier based on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2.

Used with:
- One PWM fan (tested with a Noctua NF-A20 PWM 5V)
- One AHT30 humidity and temperature sensor
- One 2 digit seven segment display (10 pins, common cathode)
- Two basic rotary encoders with click

This is a rather bespoke project designed for my particular needs,
but maybe someone else might find this useful.
